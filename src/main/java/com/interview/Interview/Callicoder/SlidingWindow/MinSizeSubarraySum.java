Smallest Subarray with a given sum

Given an array of positive integers a and a positive number K, find the length of the smallest contiguous subarray
whose sum is greater than or equal to K. Return 0 if no such subarray exists.

Variations of the problem

Find the length of the smallest contiguous subarray whose sum is equal to K (Instead of greater than equal to K).
Check out the approach for this variation â†’
What if the array has negative numbers as well?
Example 1:

Input: a = [2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 5], K = 7
Output: 2
Explanation: The smallest subarray with a sum greater than or equal to '7' is [4, 3]
Example 2:

Input: [3, 4, 1, 1, 6], K = 8
Output: 3
Explanation: Smallest subarrays with sum greater than or equal to '8' are [3, 4, 1] or [1, 1, 6].
Example 3:

Input: a = [1, 3, 2, 1, 5], K = 15
Output: 0
Explanation: No subarray exists with sum greater than or equal to 15

we need to keep the sum in increasing order or a particular order ---> use monotonic stack, queue or dequeue
