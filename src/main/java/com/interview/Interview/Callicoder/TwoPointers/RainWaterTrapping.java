        The core idea is that at any index, the amount of water that can be trapped depends on the minimum of the
        tallest bars on the left and right sides â€” because water is bounded by the shorter wall.

        I use two pointers, left starting at index 0 and right at the end of the array.
        I also maintain two variables: maxLeft and maxRight to keep track of the highest bars seen so far from both ends.

        I only need to calculate trapped water at the side that has the smaller current height, because the trapped
        water at that position is guaranteed to be bounded by that side.
