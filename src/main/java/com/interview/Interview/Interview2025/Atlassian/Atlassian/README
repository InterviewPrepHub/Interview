Imagine you’re working on payments team at Atlassian. A customer subscribes to Jira and is interested in exploring
how much it’ll cost them to keep using the product for the rest of the year.
Your task is to develop a CostExplorer that calculates the total cost a customer has to pay in a unit year. This
means that at any day of the year they should be able to get a provisional report giving monthly/yearly cost estimates.
Cost Explorer should be able to provide a report of -
Monthly cost (Generate a bill for each month, including bill amount for future months for the unit year)
Yearly cost estimates (for the unit year)
Refer -

CostExplorer ->
  monthlyCostList(): Array/List of size 12 filled with cost incurred in each month of the unit year
  annualCost(): Total cost in a unit year
You are working with other teams who provides you below critical information -

Atlassian pricing plans
To keep it simple, we're keeping one pricing for all product, in reality we'll have different pricing

Customer subscription information
Initially the problem only expects one product in the list, but during scale-ups we can add multiple products into the mix


//  Atlassian pricing plans as tuple of {planId, monthlyCost}
[
  {BASIC, 9.99},
  {STANDARD, 49.99},
  {PREMIUM, 249.99}
]

//  Customer subscription information
Customer -> C1
Product ->
 Name -> Jira
 Subscription -> [ BASIC, "2021-01-01”  ] //  { planId, startDate }, date in YYYY-MM-DD format
Go ahead!
Output:
Assuming year as Jan 2021 - Dec 2021:
Since the startDate is January 01, 2021 report will look like -
Monthly Cost = [9.99, 9.99, 9.99, 9.99, 9.99, 9.99, 9.99, 9.99, 9.99, 9.99, 9.99, 9.99]
Yearly cost estimates = 119.88
For another startDate as February 01, 2021, output report will look like (pro rated) -
Monthly Cost = [0.00, 9.99, 9.99, 9.99, 9.99, 9.99, 9.99, 9.99, 9.99, 9.99, 9.99, 9.99]
Yearly cost estimates = 109.89
