One of the fun features of Aquaintly is that users can rate movies they have seen from 1 to 5. We want to use these ratings to make movie recommendations.

Ratings will be provided in the following format:
  [Member Name, Movie Name, Rating]

We consider two users to have similar taste in movies if they have both rated the same movie as 4 or 5.

A movie should be recommended to a user if:
- They haven't rated the movie
- A user with similar taste has rated the movie as 4 or 5

Example:
ratings = [
    ["Alice", "Frozen", "5"],
    ["Bob", "Mad Max", "5"],
    ["Charlie", "Lost In Translation", "4"],
    ["Charlie", "Inception", "4"],
    ["Bob", "All About Eve", "3"],
    ["Bob", "Lost In Translation", "5"],
    ["Dennis", "All About Eve", "5"],
    ["Dennis", "Mad Max", "4"],
    ["Charlie", "Topsy-Turvy", "2"],
    ["Dennis", "Topsy-Turvy", "4"],
    ["Alice", "Lost In Translation", "1"],
    ['Franz', 'Lost In Translation', '5'],
    ['Franz', 'Mad Max', '5']
]

If we want to recommend a movie to Charlie, we would recommend "Mad Max" because:
- Charlie has not rated "Mad Max"
- Charlie and Bob have similar taste as they both rated "Lost in Translation" 4 or 5
- Bob rated "Mad Max" a 5

Write a function that takes the name of a user and a collection of ratings, and returns a collection of all movie recommendations that can be made for the given user.

All test cases:
recommendations("Charlie", ratings) => ["Mad Max"]
recommendations("Bob", ratings) => ["Inception", "Topsy-Turvy"]
recommendations("Dennis", ratings) => ["Lost In Translation"]
recommendations("Alice", ratings) => []
recommendations("Franz", ratings) => ["Inception", "All About Eve", "Topsy-Turvy"]

Complexity Variable:
R = number of ratings
M = number of movies
U = number of users
