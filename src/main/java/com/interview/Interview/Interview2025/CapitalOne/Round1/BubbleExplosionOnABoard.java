/*
Youâ€™re given a board (bubbles) with integers representing bubble colors.
Explosion rules:

A bubble is eligible if it has at least 2 same-color neighbors (up/down/left/right).
If any bubble in a connected component is eligible, the entire same-color component explodes.
All marked bubbles are removed at the same time (set to 0).
After removal, apply gravity: bubbles fall down to fill empty cells in each column.
Return the final board state after one explosion.

Example:

[[3,1,2,1],
 [1,1,1,4],
 [3,1,2,2],
 [3,3,3,4]]


[[0,0,0,1],
 [0,0,0,4],
 [0,0,2,2],
 [3,0,2,4]]
