Design a logging library, which can be used by applications to log messages of different levels like info, fatal and error
Each message can be routed to multiple sinks based on the log level,
	File
           Sysout
           Queue
           Store
It does provide other capabilities of enrichment and rules
 We can define templates of {ipaddress} {timestamp} to be inserted with every message

Logging can be sync or asynchronous
Should not cause issue with performance in memory n CPU

first think about LLD  for this

think of schema before any DB and later DB
