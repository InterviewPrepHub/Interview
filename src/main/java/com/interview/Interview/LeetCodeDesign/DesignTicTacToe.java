/*
The given problem describes a tic-tac-toe game which is generalized for an n x n board, as opposed to the traditional
3 x 3 board. Two players take turns to place their mark on the board. The goal for each player is to get n of their own
marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The challenge is to implement a class TicTacToe that
can process each move made by the players and determine the status of the game after each move, specifically:

If the game continues with no winner.
If player 1 has won.
If player 2 has won.

solution thinking:

main intuition is to keep track of the number of marks each player has in rows, columns and diagonals

‚úÖ We have a count for every row, column, and diagonal.
‚úÖ We want an easy way to track if an entire line is dominated by one player.

How?
If:
	‚Ä¢	Player 1 plays -> Add +1
	‚Ä¢	Player 2 plays -> Add -1

Then:
	‚Ä¢	If a row becomes n ‚ûî All positions by Player 1 (win).
	‚Ä¢	If a row becomes -n ‚ûî All positions by Player 2 (win).

üëâ This saves you from checking every spot every time.

üéØ Simple example (size = 3):

Row counts after moves:

Player      Position        Action      rows[] Result
p1           [0,0]         row[0]+=1      [1,0,0]
p2           [1,1]         row[1]-=1      [1,-1,0]
p1           [0,1]         row[0]+=1      [2,-1,0]
p2           [2,2]         row[2]-=1      [2,-1,-1]
p3           [0,2]         row[0]+=1      [3,-1,-1]  --> 3 means player 1 wins


‚úÖ So:
	‚Ä¢	You‚Äôre NOT checking every spot.
	‚Ä¢	You‚Äôre updating one number per line.
	‚Ä¢	Result == n ‚ûî Player 1 wins.
	‚Ä¢	Result == -n ‚ûî Player 2 wins.

‚úÖ Let's Test Other Scenarios:
1. Column Win

t.move(1,0,p1)
t.move(1,1,p2)
t.move(2,0,p1) ‚Üí P1 wins by column 0

2. Diagonal Win (top-left to bottom-right)
t.move(0,0,p1)
t.move(0,1,p2)
t.move(1,1,p1)
t.move(1,2,p2)
t.move(2,2,p1) ‚Üí P1 wins by diagonal

diagonal = 3 ‚Üí works ‚úÖ

row == col

 2 |   |   | P1|

3. Anti-Diagonal Win (top-right to bottom-left)
t.move(0,2,p1)
t.move(0,0,p2)
t.move(1,1,p1)
t.move(1,0,p2)
