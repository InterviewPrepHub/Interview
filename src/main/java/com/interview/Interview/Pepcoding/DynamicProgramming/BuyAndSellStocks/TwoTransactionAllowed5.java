Best Time to Buy and Sell Stocks - Two Transaction Allowed (Hard) | Dynamic Programming

üéØ Goal:
Maximize total profit from at most two non-overlapping transactions.

We want to split the timeline (days) at every possible point i, and try:

First transaction from day 0 to day i

Second transaction from day i+1 to the end

Then, we choose the best possible split (i.e., the split that gives us the maximum combined profit).

üîÅ Why Left to Right?
In the left-to-right pass, for each day i:

We calculate the maximum profit we could have made from day 0 to day i using one transaction.

This simulates doing the first transaction ending on or before day i.

We track:

leftProfits[i] = max(leftProfits[i-1], prices[i] - minPriceSoFar);

üîÅ Why Right to Left?
In the right-to-left pass, for each day i:

We calculate the maximum profit we could make from day i to the end using one transaction.

This simulates doing the second transaction starting on or after day i.

We track:

rightProfits[i] = max(rightProfits[i+1], maxPriceSoFar - prices[i]);

üß† Intuition:
For each day i, we assume:

We make our first buy-sell before or on day i ‚Üí profit = leftProfits[i]

Then make our second buy-sell on or after day i ‚Üí profit = rightProfits[i]

Total profit at split i = leftProfits[i] + rightProfits[i]

Then we try all possible i (from 0 to n-1) and take the max of all combinations.
