/*
Java provides a ConcurrentHashMap which uses lock striping internally and is well-optimized for concurrency.
Java‚Äôs ConcurrentHashMap uses a combination of CAS (compare-and-swap) and finer-grained locking.


Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôd design:
	‚Ä¢	Buckets: An array of buckets, each bucket is typically a linked list or better, a lock-free linked list.
	‚Ä¢	CAS-based atomic operations: For lock-free insertions/removals.

CAS (Compare-And-Swap):
	‚Ä¢	CAS lets you atomically:
	‚Ä¢	Read a value
	‚Ä¢	Compare it with an expected value
	‚Ä¢	Swap in a new value if the value hasn‚Äôt changed (i.e. no other thread updated it).
	‚Ä¢	Achieved via java.util.concurrent.atomic package (AtomicReference, AtomicInteger, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	Avoids blocking like synchronized, reduces contention.

When we write multithreaded programs in Java (meaning programs where multiple tasks run at the same time),
we sometimes want to change a value (like a variable or a link in a data structure) without two threads messing
each other up. Imagine two people writing in the same notebook at the same time‚Äîit can get messy!

Java gives us special atomic classes in the package java.util.concurrent.atomic, like:
	‚Ä¢	AtomicReference<T>
	‚Ä¢	AtomicInteger
	‚Ä¢	AtomicLong

These classes let us:
‚úÖ Read a value.
‚úÖ Check a condition (e.g. is the value what I expect?).
‚úÖ Update the value‚Äîbut only if nobody else changed it in the meantime.

This read-check-update happens all at once‚Äîin one step, so no other thread can sneak in between these steps and mess things up.

üß™ What does AtomicReference do?

Let‚Äôs imagine we have a linked list, and one node points to the next. If we want to change where it points (for example,
inserting a new node at the start), two threads might try to do this at the same time.

Instead of:
head = newNode;
(which can get messed up by another thread)

We use:
head.compareAndSet(expectedHead, newNode);

This means:
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúIf head is still what I think it is (expectedHead), then change it to newNode‚Äîotherwise, don‚Äôt change it.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	This is atomic‚Äîit happens all at once.

‚∏ª

üîí Why not just use locks?

Locks are also used to protect shared data:

synchronized (lock) {
    // do something
}

But locks can be slow and can cause deadlocks (threads waiting forever).

Atomic classes give us a lock-free way to update data, which is:
‚úÖ Faster
‚úÖ More scalable
‚úÖ Less likely to freeze
