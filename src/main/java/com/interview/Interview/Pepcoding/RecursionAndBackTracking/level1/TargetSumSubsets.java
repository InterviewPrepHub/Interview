/*
For example, consider the problem of generating all subsets of a set of n elements. The number of subsets of a set is
2^n, which means the time complexity is O(2^n). This is because each element can either be included in a subset or not,
leading to 2^n possible subsets.

Combination Formula nCm

The combination formula nCm (read as "n choose m") is used to calculate the number of ways to choose
m elements from a set of n elements, without regard to the order of selection. The formula is given by:

nCm= n!/m!(nâˆ’m)!
